Module 3 challenge 
This challenge is to assess 2 different csv files and return in PyBank the average profit or loss over a period of time and take information on an election poll
We search through and add data to lists to work with then export the results desired to a txt file. 
I struggled to get the right average to appear and couldn't figure out why it wouldn't populate properly but I am confident on everything else. 
I did try some different methods in PyPoll to expedite the printing and writing to text process but did not make the same changes to my PyBank as it worked and I didn't want to break it.
